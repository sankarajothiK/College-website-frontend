        <h3>Computer Science Engineering</h3>
        <p>Department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in the year 1999 
            with a goal of creating ethically responsible and self-reliant technocrats. 
            The department offers a four year UG degree program in Computer Science and 
            Engineering with an annual intake of 120 students, two year PG degree program
             in Computer Science and Engineering with an annual intake of 18 students.
              CSE department has the significant infra structural facilities with well-equipped
               laboratories and hi-tech state of art networked computers with high speed internet
                facility. The department is gifted with a team of 28 qualified and experienced 
                faculty members who are here to guide the students in all the aspects. 
                Our department is Accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA),
                 New Delhi since May 2009 onwards</p>
